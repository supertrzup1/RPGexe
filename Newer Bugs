	don't clump instructions for two different things together (i.e map appearing during tutorial after you view inventory or failed to run away prompts being grouped with enemy attacks and player info)
	
	after you properly run away from an enemy your position on the map disapears as you're still "in" the enemy
	
	After the skeleton defeats you in still prompts you to use wasd and once you press "w, a, s, or d" it closes the program
	
	consider removing the movement prompt after you initially move using wasd
	
	consider telling the player that they kust choose an item instead of just spamming the inventory list when fighting
	
	grammar error when the orc slaps you. "Use" is capitalized in the middle of a sentance 
	
	bottom right enemy is broken (when you step on him, he disapears and nothing happens)
	
	after you kill the orc you get "tornShift"
	
	after being prompted to use an item, if you press 1 is declares your health
